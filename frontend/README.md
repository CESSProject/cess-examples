# React Frontend to Interact with CESS Local Node

This React front end is forked from [Substrate Front-end Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template).

We have modified it to demonstrate how to interact with ink! smart contract and solidity smart contract deployed on CESS local dev node and testnet. The changes are mostly in:

- [`src/ProofOfExistenceInk.js`](./src/ProofOfExistenceInk.js)
- [`src/ProofOfExistenceSolidity.js`](./src/ProofOfExistenceSolidity.js)
